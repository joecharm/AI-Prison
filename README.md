# AI-Prison
This experience is a prison courtyard, the player is surrounded by an AI crowd and NPC’s which can be interacted with. The aim of the experience is to identify who has smuggled in the phone to the prison, once the player is confident, they can tell the guard. Each NPC has their own dialogue and path in the story, the path taken between characters will also impact how the other NPC’s respond to some comments. This helps to simulate the NPC’s having friends and enemies.
